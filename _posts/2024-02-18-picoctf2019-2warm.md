## Challenge Details

> **Site:** [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/)  
> **Author:** Sanjay C/Danny Tunitis  
> **Description:** Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?  
> **Files:** N/A  
> **Points:** 50  
> * *Hint 1: Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.*

## Investigation

Let's use the online calculator at [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/base-converter.html) and convert 0x3D from base10 to base2 (binary). The answer is **101010**. If we wrap that in the picoCTF format we have the flag. Simple.

### Flag

> FLAG = picoCTF{101010}
