Refer to the [first entry](../picoctf2021-obedient_cat) in this series for folder structure and tips.

## Challenge Details

> **Site:** [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/)  
> **Author:** Sanjay C/Danny T  
> **Description:** What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.  
> **Files:** N/A  
> **Points:** 100  
> * *Hint 1: Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.*

## Investigation

Create a folder in the relevant directory.

```bash
cd general_skills
mkdir bases && cd $_
```

The description leads us to believe the string is probably encoded with base64. We can use the online decoder at [Base64Decode](https://www.base64decode.org/) to decode the string and then wrap the result in the format expected and we get picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}.

Let's create a python file to decode and create the string for us to learn some more skills.

```python
import base64

encoded = "bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1"

print("picoCTF" + "{" + base64.b64decode(encoded).decode('utf-8') + "}")
```

```bash
python tinker.py
picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}
```

### Flag

> FLAG = picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}
{: .prompt-tip }

Mark our folder as solved.

```bash
cd ..
mv bases{,_SOLVED}
```
