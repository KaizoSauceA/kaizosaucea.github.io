## Challenge Details

> **Site:** [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/)  
> **Author:** LT 'syreal' Jones  
> **Description:** Fix the syntax error in this Python script to print the flag. Download Python script   
> **Files:** [fixme1.py](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/27/fixme1.py)  
> **Points:** 100  
> * *Hint 1: Indentation is very meaningful in Python*  
> * *Hint 2: To view the file in the webshell, do: $ nano fixme1.py*  
> * *Hint 3: To exit nano, press Ctrl and x and follow the on-screen prompts.*  
> * *Hint 4: The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge*  

## Investigation

Create a folder in the relevant directory, download the zip file and extract.

```bash
cd general_skills
mkdir fixme1 && cd $_
wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/27/fixme1.py
```

Based on the fact that the challenge is called fixme, let's run the file and see if we get an error first.

```bash
python fixme1.py
  File "/home/kali/Documents/PicoCTF/general_skills/fixme1/fixme1.py", line 20
    print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

Looks like we have an indentation error. Let's duplicate the file to a new tinker.py and try to fix it.

```bash
cp fixme1.py tinker.py 
code tinker.py
```

All we need to do is remove the indents on lines 18 and 20, save the file and then rerun it to get the flag.

```python
flag = str_xor(flag_enc, 'enkidu')
print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
```

```bash
python tinker.py      
That is correct! Here's your flag: picoCTF{1nd3nt1ty_cr1515_182342f7}
```

### Flag

> FLAG = picoCTF{1nd3nt1ty_cr1515_182342f7}
{: .prompt-tip }

Mark our folder as solved.

```bash
cd ..
mv fixme1{,_SOLVED}
```
