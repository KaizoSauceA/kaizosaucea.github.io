## Challenge Details

> **Site:** [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/)  
> **Author:** LT 'syreal' Jones  
> **Description:** Fix the syntax error in this Python script to print the flag. Download Python script   
> **Files:** [fixme2.py](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/4/fixme2.py)  
> **Points:** 100  
> * *Hint 1: Are equality and assignment the same symbol?*  
> * *Hint 2: To view the file in the webshell, do: $ nano fixme2.py*  
> * *Hint 3: To exit nano, press Ctrl and x and follow the on-screen prompts.*  
> * *Hint 4: The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge*  

## Investigation

Create a folder in the relevant directory, download the py file.

```bash
cd general_skills
mkdir fixme2 && cd $_
wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/4/fixme2.py
```

Let's execute the file to see what errors we get.

```bash
python fixme2.py 
  File "/home/kali/Documents/PicoCTF/general_skills/fixme2/fixme2.py", line 22
    if flag = "":
       ^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?
```

We have a syntax error. Let's copy the file and open the copy in a code editor.

```bash
cp fixme2.py tinker.py 
code tinker.py
```

From the previous error, let's look at line 22. The check for flag being equal to an empty string is incorrect syntax. A single = sign is assignment to a variable, not a boolean check. Let's fix it and run our new file.

```python
# Check that flag is not empty
# previously if flag = "":
if flag == "":
  print('String XOR encountered a problem, quitting.')
else:
  print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
```

```bash
python tinker.py 
That is correct! Here's your flag: picoCTF{3qu4l1ty_n0t_4551gnm3nt_e8814d03}
```

### Flag

> FLAG = picoCTF{3qu4l1ty_n0t_4551gnm3nt_e8814d03}
{: .prompt-tip }

Mark our folder as solved.

```bash
cd ..
mv fixme2{,_SOLVED}
```
