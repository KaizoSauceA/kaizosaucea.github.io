Refer to the [first entry](../picoctf2021-obedient_cat) in this series for folder structure and tips.

## Challenge Details

> **Site:** [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/)  
> **Author:** Pandu  
> **Description:** Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? *cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_MAZyqFQj}*  
> **Files:** N/A  
> **Points:** 10  
> * *Hint 1: This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!*

## Investigation

Create a folder in the relevant directory.

```bash
cd cryptography
# create new directory AND cd into it
mkdir mod_26 && cd $_
```

[Wikipedia entry for ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)  
ROT13 is a substitution cypher that replaces one letter of the alphabet with another based on a shift of 13

### Online Tool

Using the online decoder at [cryptii.com](https://cryptii.com/pipes/rot13-decoder) and setting the decode parameters to ROT13 (A-Z,a-z) if we paste in our string *cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_MAZyqFQj}* we get back the decoded flag:

> picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_ZNMldSDw}

### Python Library

That was easy. Let's try and understand the method and get some coding practice. Open python in your code editor, I'm using vscode.

```bash
code rot13.py
```

Python has a built in **codecs** library so let's use that to solve the challenge.

```python
import codecs

# encoded sting from challenge
data = "cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_MAZyqFQj}"

# using builtin codecs library
easy = codecs.decode(data, 'rot_13')
print(f"Builtin: {easy}")
```

### Python Manual Method

Let's work out how to do this manually for more practice. There are numerous ways to go about this. We can use the string library to generate the alphabet in upper and lower case. Concatenate them. Then we create a shifted alphabet by slicing each alphabet in half (13) and concatenating them. We end up with two strings now that we can use to map from one to the other.

* alphabet "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
* shift "NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm"

All we need to do now is tie it all together.

```python
import codecs
import string

# encoded sting from challenge
data = "cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_MAZyqFQj}"

# online solver: https://cryptii.com/pipes/rot13-decoder
# picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_ZNMldSDw}

# using builtin codecs library
easy = codecs.decode(data, 'rot_13')
print(f"Builtin: {easy}")

# manual method
upper = string.ascii_uppercase
lower = string.ascii_lowercase
alphabet = upper + lower
shift = upper[13:] + upper[:13] + lower[13:] + lower[:13]

# placeholder answer to append decoded letters
manual = ""

# iterate through encoded string and decode each character, ignoring numbers and special characters
for letter in data:
    
    if letter in alphabet:
        manual += shift[alphabet.find(letter)]
    
    else:
        manual += letter

print(f"Manual:  {manual}")

# final logic test to ensure manual method matches builtin
print(f"Match:   {easy == manual}")
```

We have now found the flag three different ways and learned a few new tricks.

### Flag
